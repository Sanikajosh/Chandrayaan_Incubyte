# Chandrayaan_Incubyte
task is to desigThe program enables Chandrayaan 3 to execute Move, Turn and Turn(up/down) commands accurately and efficiently in the vast expanse of the galaxy.


To create a program that translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the Chandrayaan 3 spacecraft, you can use C++ to implement the functionalities 
you described. We will maintain the spacecraft's position and orientation and update them based on the received commands.

In this program:

We define a space class to represent the spacecraft's state.
The move method updates the spacecraft's position based on the current direction.
The turn method rotates the spacecraft's direction.
The action method takes a string of commands and executes them one by one.
get_position and get_direction methods return the current position and direction of the spacecraft, respectively.

This program should give you a starting point for controlling Chandrayaan 3 in a galactic coordinate system based on the provided commands.
